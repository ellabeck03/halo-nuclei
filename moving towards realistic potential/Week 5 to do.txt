Use our established method to get a fit (10 gaussians? Can be adjusted) (make sure it also works for the S orbital state that has no spin orbit coupling)
Produce Log plots to show goodness of fit, also look at the mathmatica notebook Jagjit showed us for ideas
Use these to get the ground state energies using out tuned parameters (and also present the paper with them in?).
